        One of the best recipes you'll find out there, on the internet, on how to make the ultimate lasagna.

        into a casserole.

        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and
            crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar.
            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in
            the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set
            aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><em>Mix cottage cheese</em></strong>, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley,
            salt, and
            pepper in a large
            bowl until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat
            it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover.<br>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of
            the
            remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles,
            cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><em>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes.</em></strong> Remove the foil and bake until
            cheese is golden brown, 5 to
            10 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
